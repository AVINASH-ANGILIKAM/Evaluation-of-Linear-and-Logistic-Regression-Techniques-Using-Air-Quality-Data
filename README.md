# Evaluation-of-Linear-and-Logistic-Regression-Techniques-Using-Air-Quality-Data
## Introduction
This report explores two regression techniques, Linear Regression and Logistic Regression, applied to the Air Quality dataset. Linear Regression is used to predict temperature values based on pollutant levels, while Logistic Regression classifies CO levels into High and Low categories. The report discusses preprocessing, modeling, and analysis, accompanied by relevant visualizations.
